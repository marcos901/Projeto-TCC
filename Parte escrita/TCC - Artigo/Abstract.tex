\textbf{Abstract: }
Basketball is one of the most watched and practiced sports in the world. With a large public began to be used tools for technical analysis, which can be used for strategic purposes by managers and even punters. Thus arose several interests in predicting the outcome of their matches. The computer systems that use the prediction started to be used to help in the formation of new strategies, techniques and tactics of the game. This project aims to use artificial intelligence algorithms to predict basketball matches. There are currently several prediction algorithms for different characteristics. With this project using several algorithms you can know which are the most suitable for predicting data in basketball matches.\\
