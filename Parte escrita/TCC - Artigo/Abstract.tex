\textbf{Abstract: }
Basketball and one of the most watched sports is practiced in the world with this has arisen several interests in the prediction of using matches. Therefore the computational systems that use the prediction have been used to assist in the formation of new strategies for those who need more accurate and reliable data. This project aimed to use artificial intelligence algorithms to predict basketball games. Currently there are several prediction algorithms for several characteristics, so in this project when using several algorithms you can know which are the most suitable for predicting data in basketball games.\\
